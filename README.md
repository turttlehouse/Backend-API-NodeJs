## Introduction

This backend application is a simple task management system that provides RESTful API endpoints for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks. Each task includes a title and a status (completed or pending). The application uses Node.js as the server-side framework, Express for handling HTTP requests, MySQL as the relational database, Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, and Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

## Requirements

To run the backend application, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js : You can download it from here - https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Xampp   : You can download XAMPP from here - https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
- Download CodeEditor : You can download Vscode from here - https://code.visualstudio.com/download                                                                     
   Note: Visual Studio Code is the recommended code editor, but you can use other code editors as well.  

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/turttlehouse/Backend-API-NodeJs.git
    
2. Install dependencies: npm install
 
3.  Create a MySQL Database: Open XAMPP and create a new MySQL database named "taskmanagementsystem" to store your data.

## Usage

The server will start, and you can access the API endpoints at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30063163/2s9YeK39ff

## Validation

Validation is implemented to ensure that required fields are not empty. The application handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes for invalid requests.

## API Documentation

API documentation is available [here]-https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30063163/2s9YeK39ff.
It includes information on making requests, expected responses, and any authentication requirements.
